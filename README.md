# Challenge-PWA

The challenge was to build in one day an PWA with the technology of our choice.

## The chosen technology
I've chosen to work with Flutter since it's natively compiled with a service worker and because I've done pwa with web Angular before so I wanted to try something new.

## What as been done?

Not much but the app is installable on smartphone pc and tablet and is responsive on those devices. 

## What were the challenges?

Learning a new language in a day. I had basics of Flutter but not much so learning how to do responsive design was the main challenge of the day.
